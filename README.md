# rusty-link

A wrapper for the [Ableton Link](https://github.com/Ableton/link) library, a technology that synchronizes musical beat,
tempo, and phase across multiple applications running on one or more devices. Applications on devices connected to a
local network discover each other automatically and form a musical session in which each participant can perform
independently: anyone can start or stop while still staying in time. Anyone can change the tempo, the others will
follow. Anyone can join or leave without disrupting the session.

For further details, see [Ableton Link](https://github.com/Ableton/link).
