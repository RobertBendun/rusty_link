//! # Rusty Link
//!
//! Rusty Link is a Rust wrapper of [abl_link](https://github.com/Ableton/link/tree/master/extensions/abl_link), which
//! is a C 11 wrapper made by Ableton for their C++ codebase.
//! This library attempts to be as unopinionated and plain as possible in
//! copying the functionality of abl_link, while hiding unsafe behaviour and
//! providing Rust's guarantees.
//!
//! See [README.md](https://github.com/anzbert/rusty_link) for more info.
